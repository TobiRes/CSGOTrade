    <h2 class="title">General Information</h2>
    <p>This app was created to make mobile trading easier. Hopefully this app is useful for you as well. If you want to
      message me directly, just hit me up on reddit - /u/CSGOTradeApp.
    </p>
    <h2 class="title">FAQ</h2>
    <h5>What can this app do?</h5>
    <p>
      1. View posts on /r/Globaloffensivetrade <br>
      2. Search posts on /r/Globaloffensivetrade<br>
      3. Send Tradeoffers with items you selected<br>
      4. Show Metjm-Screenshots<br>
      5. Display your Steam Inventory<br>
    </p>
    <h5>How do I enter my profile?</h5>
    <p>
      You can either enter your profile url directly from your inventory or when asked to in the trading process with either your custom-URL or SteamID like this:
      <br>
      <br>
      1. steamcommunity.com/id/customURL<br>
      2. steamcommunity.com/profiles/1234567890<br>
      3. customURL<br>
      4. 1234567890<br>
      <br>
      You can always update or change it directly from the inventory tab.
    </p>
    <h5>What do the colors next to the post mean?</h5>
    <p>
      They simply highlight what kind of post it is - e.g. orange for a trade, blue for a discussion.
    </p>
    <h5>Is the app safe to use?</h5>
    <p>
      The app doesn´t: <br>
      <br>
      1. Send trade offers without you accepting them <br>
      2. Send trade offers without you viewing the trade offers in the official tradeoffer window<br>
      3. Send trade offers without you selecting any items, or select items by itself <br>
      4. Accept trade offers <br>
      5. Do anything on steam you don´t want it to <br>
      6. Sell any items on the market<br>
      7. Send any data out, except to the official Steam servers. <br>
      8. Know anything about you, your reddit account, or your steam login information.<br>
      <br>
      It basically is a browser extension which displays the items before the offer. The trade itself is still done via Steam directly and has to be accepted from your Mobile-Authenticator.
      If you have any concerns, just wait for others to give some feedback or message me directly on reddit (see "General Information").
    </p>
    <h5>How does the whole process work?</h5>
    <p>
      You can view the posts by going to the Home-Page, or by searching for them in the Search-Page.
      It´s then possible to click on a post to view it's content and comments. <br>
      To filter the posts, just use the filter options in the top right. Keep swiping down to load additional posts.
      <br>
      If you want to send a trade offer, simply swipe the trade post to the left and click on the appearing "Offer"
      button,
      or click on a trade post and start the process there.<br>
      When you have done one of these options, you get to a new window, where you can first select the items of your
      trade partner,
      then on the following page your items. You can filter these items by using the filter options. <br>
      If you press longer on an item, information about the item pops up and you are able to view a Metjm-Screenshot of
      the item.
      When you click on a key, you are prompted in the same way to select the amount of keys you want to trade. <br>
      Once you have selected all the items you want to trade for, you can review the trade before clicking on the "Send
      Trade Offer"-Button. When you click it,
      a browser window opens with the Steam-Tradeoffer window, where the items are already filled in - though you need
      to
      log in first.<br>
      After you verify that everything got set correctly, you can send the offer and accept it with the offical
      Steam-App. <br>

      If you want to view your inventory, simply go to the Inventory-Page and enter your profile Information. You can
      also get informations about your items there,
      in the same way as in the trade process.
    </p>
    <h5>What are some upcoming features?</h5>
    <p>
      Working on the following - I'm still a student, so be patient with me.<br>
      1. Better UX-Design. Sorry - not my strength.<br>
      2. Post on /r/Globaloffensivetrade <br>
      3. View price information on items <br>
      4. Show float information <br>
    </p>
